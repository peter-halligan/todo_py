# 100 days log

## day 3
today is day 3 of the 100 days challenge, I have changed the goal from 1 hour a day to 10 minutes a day. As I feel commiting to an hour a bit daunting while trying to recover from burn out.

The funny thing is with the smaller goal i have spent more than an hour today on my goal. Just without the pressure of i have to do it.

Today i added code coverage to the project.
I achieve this by.
1. install coverage
2. created a codecov account
3. added my org to codecov
4. added the api key to github secrets
5. adding and emtpy codecov.yml to the root directory allows a report to be displayed on a PR
6. added the badge to the README.md
7. i updated the test command to run with coverage rather than python

Day4 my loose plan is to implement a branching and commit formatting standard (probably conventional commits)
and document this this will allow me to think about what a release workflow will look like.
